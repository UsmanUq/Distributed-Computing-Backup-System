this is the sample file that is to be distributed across nodes by master, namely port 5001 and port 5002. the nodes are made live first, then the master.py acting as a server through server() and the controller of data. While client.py takes the name of the file as <filename.filetype>, and sends it to master.py to be distributed across nodes 1 and 2 (can be increased). After the file is broken into chunks and stopred in the nodes, data from one node is deleted, fetching data from the node runs an error handling func which says file not present, fetching from <portname>, if present it says file fetched from <portname>. 
what i need my code to so id this, 1. separate code files for master, storage (nodes) and client. all in python
